# 3D-Particle-Word-System
This application allows users to create and manage particle word on your browser.

This application is created using WebGL and three.js libraries.


# Requirements
The application only needs a web browser compatible with WebGL (you can see if your browser is compatible here https://get.webgl.org/).

If the generation is slow, just reload the page.


# Start Application
To start the application just open the index.html file in the root directory and view the generation of the default text "CG-3D".


# Interaction
You can stop, resume or restart the text generation using the button on the top of the page.

You can change the text using the textinput choosing from the available letters and clicking the "Confirm" button.

You can change options using the top right dashboard to change the color, the trasparency, the number of particles, the spawn rate etc...

You can also explode the text using the "Explode" button or fall down all the particles using the "Crumble" button.

Enjoy
